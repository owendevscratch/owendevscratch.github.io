# Violet cube simulator
Made this github to host a poorly made violet cube simulator.
It's pretty basic and I threw it together really quickly.
Code is quite messy and tons of stuff is hard coded.
Doesn't look pretty either, but whatever.

There's a few assumptions made:
1) Line weights are the same as in kms
2) Prime vs. secondary line probability is accurate

If anyone wants to take this and make it better (honestly wouldn't be too difficult), please feel free.
Please see the issues for some ideas for what I don't feel like doing, but can easily be done.
